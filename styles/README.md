# What Is Second Memory?

I write lots of notes, about almost everything. Writing is a very important part of my work and of my organization in general.
After trying several note taking tools and not being happy with any of them, I figured I had to start building my own.

Second memory is a way to keep loose notes, journals and TODO lists inside of Atom editor.
All source text is written in plain markdown format, and you can structure your documents in whatever way you want.

Base features include:

  - a simple grammar that covers most markdown elements
  - an easy to customize markdown source syntax highlighting
  - a simple TODO concept, with priorities
  - rotating text labels
